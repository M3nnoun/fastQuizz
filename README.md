# FastQuizz  

FastQuizz is an AI-powered application designed to revolutionize the way teachers create quizzes and assess student performance. By leveraging advanced technology, FastQuizz saves teachers time, enhances student engagement, and empowers data-driven decision-making in education.

## Features  

- **AI-Powered Quiz Generation**: Generate customized quizzes from uploaded lecture documents (PDF).  
- **Performance Analytics** (Coming Soon): Analyze individual and class performance to make data-driven decisions.

## Inspiration  

The traditional exam system is often ineffective, with students learning just to pass exams and quickly forgetting the material afterward. Teachers also spend significant time creating quizzes, leaving little room to focus on other important tasks. FastQuizz was built to address these challenges and create a smarter solution for both students and educators.

## Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**: Next.js (Full-stack framework)  
- **Database**: Firebase (Scalable and real-time data storage)  
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (Quiz generation based on lecture documents)

## How It Works  

1. **Upload a PDF**: Teachers upload lecture documents directly into the app.  
2. **AI-Generated Quizzes**: The app generates quizzes automatically based on the content.  
3. **Performance Tracking** (Coming Soon): Teachers will be able to analyze student performance and make informed decisions.
